# Test Task Notes

Project is written with Options API, because there were no requirement in test task requirement, though i prefer to use Composition API.
Moreoften, teams if it needed, define it in test tasks, if they really need Composition API.

BEFORE RUNNING: Please, make sure that backend app is running on port 9191, or set any other port in which it runs.
the server app url is hardcoded in the app, for sake of simplicity, though it should be in .env file in any real project.
